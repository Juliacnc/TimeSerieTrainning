# TimeSerieTrainning
## Why
Training is the key to success. Whether one is a junior or senior, with or without 20 years of experience, it is important to constantly challenge oneself in order to continuously improve and stay up to date. This repository aims to gather the training exercises I have conducted on time series. Constructive feedback is welcome (with kindness :wink:).
